## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
The collection of Linked Data is evergrowing and many datasets are frequently being updated.
In order to fully exploit the potential of the information that is available in and over historical dataset versions,
<!-- Need         -->
we need to be able to store and query Linked Datasets efficiently.
<!-- Task         -->
In this demonstration, we introduce OSTRICH, which is an efficient triple store with versioned querying support.
<!-- Object       -->
We demonstrate the capabilities of OSTRICH using a Web-based graphical user interface in which a store can be opened or created.
Using this interface, the user is able to querying in, between and over different versions,
ingest new versions, and retrieve summarizing statistics.
