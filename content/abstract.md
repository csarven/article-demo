## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
The Linked Open Data cloud is evergrowing and many datasets are frequently being updated.
In order to fully exploit the potential of the information that is available in and over historical dataset versions,
such as discovering evolution of taxonomies or diseases in biomedical datasets,
<!-- Need         -->
we need to be able to store and query the different versions of Linked Datasets efficiently.
<!-- Task         -->
In this demonstration, we introduce OSTRICH, which is an efficient triple store with supported for versioned query evaluation.
<!-- Object       -->
We demonstrate the capabilities of OSTRICH using a Web-based graphical user interface in which a store can be opened or created.
Using this interface, the user is able to query _in_, _between_, and _over_ different versions,
ingest new versions, and retrieve summarizing statistics.
