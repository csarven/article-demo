## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
The collection of Linked Data is evergrowing and many datasets are frequently being updated.
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">Confusing first sentence. Is <q>collection</q> here the act of collecting, or the LOD cloud? Very genericâ€¦ I'd rephrase, focusing on the update part.</span>
In order to fully exploit the potential of the information that is available in and over historical dataset versions,
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">Can you list a couple of use cases that better demonstrate this need? Why would we want this in the first place?</span>
<!-- Need         -->
we need to be able to store and query Linked Datasets efficiently.
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">We already have that. Versions, you mean? ðŸ˜‰</span>
<!-- Task         -->
In this demonstration, we introduce OSTRICH, which is an efficient triple store with supported for versioned query evaluation.
<!-- Object       -->
We demonstrate the capabilities of OSTRICH using a Web-based graphical user interface in which a store can be opened or created.
Using this interface, the user is able to query _in_, _between_, and _over_ different versions,
ingest new versions, and retrieve summarizing statistics.
