## Conclusions

RDF archiving has been an active area of research over the last couple of years.
OSTRICH is storage and querying system for RDF archives that allows various kinds of versioned queries.
Flexible RDF versioning systems lower the barrier towards historical analysis over datasets that evolve over time,
such as biomedical patient information or certain taxonomies.
Furthermore, these systems make it possible to efficiently archive such datasets.

In this article, we introduce OSTRICH Admin,
which is a Web application in which versioned RDF datasets can be managed.
Two example datasets are provided, using which the capabilities of OSTRICH can be discovered.

In the future, we will continue improving the performance of OSTRICH,
and do an extensive performance evaluation.
OSTRICH Admin will be kept up-to-date with the functionality of OSTRICH,
so that OSTRICH datasets can be discovered and managed at a high-level using this Web application,
without having to use the programmatic API for this.
