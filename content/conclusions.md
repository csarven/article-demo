## Conclusions
{:#conclusions}

RDF archiving has been an active area of research over the last couple of years.
OSTRICH is storage and querying system for RDF archives that supports various kinds of versioned queries.
With OSTRICH, versioned datasets can be stored efficiently,
while at the same time enabling efficient support for versioned queries.
When OSTRICH is combined with techniques such as Triple Pattern Fragments,
versioned Linked Datasets can be published at a low cost,
and complex SPARQL queries can be evaluated _in_, _between_, and _over_ the different versions.
This lower the barrier towards historical analysis over datasets that evolve over time,
such as biomedical patient information or certain taxonomies.

In the future, we will continue improving the performance of OSTRICH,
and do an extensive performance evaluation.
OSTRICH Admin will be kept up-to-date with the functionality of OSTRICH,
so that OSTRICH datasets can be discovered and managed at a high-level using this Web application,
without having to use the programmatic API for this.
