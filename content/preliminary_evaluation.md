## Preliminary Evaluation
{:#preliminary_evaluation}

For our preliminary evaluation, we have used the BEAR-B-hourly dataset from the [BEAR benchmark](cite:cites bear).
This dataset contains around 48.000 triples over 1.299 versions,
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">Can you describe a bit better the changes that occur? 8GB for 48.000 triples sounds weird (and small).</span>
and requires 8,314.86 MB when stored as N-Triples (466.35Â MB gzipped).
[](#results-ostrich-ingestion-size-bearb-hourly) shows the growth of an OSTRICH store after the ingestion of each consecutive version of this dataset.
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">Can you comment a bit? Good, bad, needs improvement? Comparison to others?</span>
Using OSTRICH, this dataset requires only 450.59 MB to be stored, or 187.46 MB without the optimizing indexes.
Furthermore, a dataset with an average of 17M triples over 10 versions requires 4.48 GB of storage,
and 3.03 GB if only the essential querying indexes are enabled.
OSTRICH requires significantly less storage space than IC and TB strategies, but more than CB strategies.

Fig. 2, 3 and 4 show the average query evaluation times for VM, DM and VQ triple pattern queries on this BEAR-B-hourly dataset.
In these figures, the evaluation times of OSTRICH are compared with versioning systems implemented based on [HDT](cite:cites hdt) and [Jena](cite:cites jena),
as provided by the BEAR benchmark.
At the cost of ingestion times that are mostly higher than in alternative solutions,
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">how much?</span>
OSTRICH is able to significantly reduce query times for VM, DM and VQ triple pattern queries.
Results have shown that the average query times range between 0.1 and 1 milliseconds,
which is lower than most alternative solutions.
Only for VM queries on individual HDT copies, OSTRICH is slightly slower, while it requires less storage space.
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">Need to explain better the green line that's below OSTRICH (extreme storage requirements). Draw the conclusions explicitly for the readers.</span>
